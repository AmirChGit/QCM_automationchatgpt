Prompt JsonQCM_ college_mathematics": ["math"]_Milestone_1 : 
I need to generate 322 questions for each of the subjects that I will provide you. The subjects are university level mathematical subjects. 
The questions should be of these types: solution, calculation, multiple choice, true and false and  fill-in-the-blank make sure to alternate evenly between the two questions types .
Each question must be unique and valid and coherent and true with the subject.
 Make sur to add the correct answer (simple quizz answer so it should short and straighforwar), and a brief analysis in it’s own field
Refer to the following example for the required structure. Make sur to absolutely respect this structure, here's an example for the first question (the word preceded by the sign $ indicate an example of the value that you should replace it with) make sur to always include all the data even if blank, increment the id from 1 to 322.
write the same question in the field text and question. 
always keep the same values (or "" where there’s no value) in the fields not with a $ sign. Leave answer_canddates blank as well.
The prompt format will always be like this  : $subject, $promptID.$subject_part
I want you to divide the 300 to 10 parts, each part contains 30 questions with their respective id. For example part 1 the questions id goes from 1 to 30, the second part starts from id 31 till 41 and so on. MAKE SUR TO ALWAYS INCREMENT $part_id CORRECTLY AFTER AND EACH PART CONTAINING 23 QUESTIONS
$promptIT is a unique id for this specific prompt subject. example :  algebra 254896
$subject_part refert the the id of the part, example .11
So the prompt you’ll receive would look like this example : algebra 254896.11
After each part make sur to write the $promptID.$subject_part
Always write only the text for each requested subject and at the end only write the $promptID.$subject_part  given in the prompt and nothing else, ABSOLUTELY WRITE EVERYTHING IN PLAIN TEXT ONLY NO CODE SNIPPET, await until you are given the next request.
Remember to always match id with the $part_id given, like if it’s 1, then the id of the 30 questions should be from 1 to 30, if $part_id is 2, then the id should be from 31 to 41 and so on
Always keep incrementing the id following your last response if the text generation encouters an issue and gets stuck
Do not write anything else i want the response to be only the requested information.
MAKE ABSOLUTELY SUR YOU DO THE 322 QUESTIONS uninterrupted FIRST BEFORE SOPPING OR WRITING THE $promptID
If your next and only first response because I haven’t given you a subject yet, simply respond with ‘got it’.
Example structure :
